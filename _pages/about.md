I'm a second year PhD in applied math at UCLA, mentored by professor [Andrea Bertozzi](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi/). Before that, I earned my B.S. and M.A. in applied math, specialization in computing, at UCLA as an undergraduate. My current research interests lie in numerical analysis and applied partial differential equations. Check my [CV](https://ZT220501.github.io/files/Resume_Zheng_Tan.pdf) to know more about me.
