I'm a first year PhD in applied math at UCLA. I also earned my undergraduate degree in applied math, specialization in computing, at UCLA as an undergraduate. My current research interests lie in numerical analysis and applied partial differential equations. Check my [CV](https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/Resume_Zheng_Tan.pdf) to know more about me.
